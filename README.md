# ExportDataFromSqlServerManagementExpress
If you are goign to export data from Sql Server Studio Management Express, you don't have much options. I had a free server on AWS and was goign to export my blog data to SQL Azure. This script help me to extract insert statements and migrate my posts to azure.
I am hoping this is helpful.
